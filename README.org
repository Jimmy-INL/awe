* Description
  AWE provides a framework for adaptive sampling of molecular dynamics using WorkQueue to execute tasks.
  The framework decouples the resampling algorithm and the molecular dynamics from the task distribution.

* Capabilities
  - Any MD package (Gromacs, NAMD, ProtoMol, CHARMM, AMBER, ...)
	Tasks that run on the worker are defined as scripts that are cached on each worker, so they are only sent once.
  - Flexible resampling
	The AWE framework defines an IResampler interface. We provide an implementation, but you are free do define your own.

* Master Dependencies
  - [[https://github.com/badi/trax][Trax (Transactional Logging library in Python)]] (in 'extern')
  - [[http://python.org/][Python 2.7]]
  - [[http://numpy.scipy.org/][Numpy 1.5.1+]]
  - [[http://www.csb.pitt.edu/prody/][ProDy 0.9.4+]]
  - [[http://cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue/][WorkQueue (CCTools)]]

** Optional
  - Gromacs (tested)
  - NAMD (untested)

* Worker Dependencies
  This depends on the MD package used (ie the input to Gromacs differs from that for NAMD), as well as the assignment protocol.
  The example script uses Gromacs in order to run MD and depends on MSMBuilder 2 to assign the resulting trajectories to the cell definitions.

* Installation
  This assumes the master dependencies have been installed.

  First, install the dependency (some are provided in the 'extern' directory).
  Then:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  $ python setup.py install --prefix <path/to/installation/directory>
  #+END_SRC

* Running
  AWE is provided as a python library, therefore in order to run, you need to create the appropriate python objects and run a python script.
  There are four major components:
	1. The WorkQueue configuration
	2. A System definition.
	   This is done by defining Cells and adding Walkers to the cells.
	3. An IResampler instance.
	   Use one of the provided algorithms or define you own.
	4. A global structure that then runs the algorithms.

  The end result is that you run your script like so:
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  $ python example.py
  #+END_SRC

  Please see example.py in order to get started.
