This directory exists as a temporary store for pickled Walkers.
AWE-WQ currently pickled Walker instances and sends them along
with other Task information so that on return the associated
Walker may be identified.

TBD: Convert to using a fixed number of Walkers so that we are
     not constantly creating objects. This whole issue could
     be avoided if wid alone could be sent along with the Task
     instead of sending a whole Walker.
